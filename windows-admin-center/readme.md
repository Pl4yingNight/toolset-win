# Windows Admin Center (WAC)
WAC formally called Project **Honolulu** is a **free** web based Windows Management Application that unifies several Windows Server Tools.
WAC runs best on **Chromium** based browsers, **Google Chrome** and **Microsoft Edge**. WAC can be downloaded *subscription free* [here](https://aka.ms/WACDownload).

In case you desire to skip the enormous amount of ads in both browsers you have the option to [download Chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/) as `.zip` and use just that.
