# Windows Admin Center (WAC)
WAC formally called Project **Honolulu** is a **free** web based
Windows Management Application that unifies several Windows Server Tools.
WAC runs best on **Chromium** based browsers, **Google Chrome** and
**Microsoft Edge**. WAC can be downloaded *subscription free*
<a href="https://aka.ms/WACDownload" target="_blank">here</a>.

In case you desire to skip the enormous amount of ads in both browsers you have
the option to <a href="https://download-chromium.appspot.com/" target="_blank">download Chromium</a>
as `.zip` and use just that.
If you decompress it in Documents you can call it with following command,
it is recommended to put it in a link!

```batch
%UserProfile%\Documents\chrome-win\chrome.exe https://your.server.address-or-url.local
```

Exsample
```batch
%UserProfile%\Documents\chrome-win\chrome.exe https://ms1sr.sr09.fh.local
```
